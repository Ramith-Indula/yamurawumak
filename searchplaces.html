            <p class="place-description">The Gangaramaya Buddhist temple is a beautiful and vibrant temple with a history that dates back over 2,000 years.

            <p class="place-description">The Galle Face is a five hectare ocean-side urban park, which stretches for a half kilometre along the coast, in the heart of the financial and business district of Colombo, Sri Lanka. The promenade was initially laid out in 1859 by Governor Sir Henry George Ward, although the original Galle Face Green extended over a much larger area than is seen today. The Galle Face Green was initially used for horse racing and as a golf course, but was also used for cricket, polo, football, tennis and rugby.</p>

            <p class="place-description"> Located in the outskirts of Colombo, Attidiya Bird Sanctuary is a small land (may be the only place near Colombo) for the birds and other animals to take refuge in. I was surprised at the biodiversity which I encountered for a place that is right in the backyard of Colombo city.</p>

            <p class="place-description">Pettah. It's the oldest, most interesting and perhaps most underrated (at least by Southern Colombars) part of the city. Whatever the more sheltered denizens of Colombo-South may think this teaming, multi-ethnic-warren remains the beating heart of the capital. Almost all the food we buy, a good proportion of the white goods/electronics we use and virtually all the piping, wiring, nuts, bolts and nails that hold together our homes, as well as every sock, hanky and hair clip you've ever bought passes through Pettah's complex wholesale/retail ecosystem at some point. </p>
